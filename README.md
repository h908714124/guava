# Guava: Google Core Libraries for Java

[![guava](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.github.jbock-java/guava/badge.svg?subject=guava)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.github.jbock-java/guava)

This is a fork of [guava](https://github.com/google/guava)
but with a `module-info.java` and a gradle build.
As with the original guava, you should not persist serialized forms
and expect them to be compatible with future versions.
